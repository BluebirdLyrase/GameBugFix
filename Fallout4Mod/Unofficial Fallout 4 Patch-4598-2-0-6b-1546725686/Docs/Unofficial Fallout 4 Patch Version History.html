<p class="h">v2.0.6b (2019-01-05)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Reverted the script fix for Defend The Hull from Bug #23912 because for some reason it causes the quest to stall once the second wave of attackers are killed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.6a (2018-12-26)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC01_TrackSystemMachine: Two lines in this script were mistakenly in the wrong order. This could result in the tracks staying inactive and the final battle in the Mechanist's Lair not starting (Bug #25620).</li>
<li>DLC03_MultiCounterAliasColIncOnDeath: Added a missing quest stage check to the function that turns on the auto-removal of dead actors, since this is needed to advance the quest in cases where that functionality is temporarily turned off. Also improved the code on DLC03MQ02FightQuestScript that toggles this functionality (Bug #25580).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.6 (2018-12-05)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The file for the power armor frame fix was in the wrong folder and thus not taking effect.</li>
<li>The pickup sounds added to Shipment_Steel_250, Shipment_Wood_250, Shipment_Rubber_large, Shipment_Ceramic_large, Shipment_Copper_large had to be restored because they had been inadvertently removed when the shipment script properties on these items were fixed (Bug #25484).</li>
<li>DLC03:FogCondenserFurnitureScript: The tracking bool added by UFO4P 2.0.1 for Bug #22143 was initialized with a wrong default value (Bug #23910).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Barney (DN083_Barney) is now essential until the player enters the trigger zone around his house, so he will no longer die for unknown reasons before his quest starts running (Bug #20438) [NR].</li>
<li>Clarabell, the named brahmin at Abernathy Farm (EncBrahminClarabell) did not respond to feeding troughs because she was never formally added to the workshop and thus never got the package to handle that (Bug #20179).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Effect Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>TeleportOutSpellEffect: Invalid property removed from TeleportSpellEffectScript (Bug #25184).</li>
<li>DLC01LvlMechProtectronPod_AbRaceProtectronEffect: Missing script properties added (Bug #24673).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>PlayerHouse_KitchenSink01Activator, PlayerHouse_Ruin_KitchenSink01Activator, Vault_Sink_01Activator, DLC06Vault_Sink_01Activator: The scripts on these objects were missing the female drinking sounds and the pointer to the Tutorial quest (Bug #23076).</li>
<li>DN015LaserEmmitter (sic, it's misspelled): Missing sound property added (Bug #21890).</li>
<li>DLC01TrackSystem_TrackDummy: Improved the fix for a missing node name from UFO4P 2.0.5 to make it apply retroactively (Bug #24678).</li>
<li>Armor_RaiderMod_Torso: The sturdy and heavy raider chest pieces did never appear in epic versions because the object templates for the epic items were mistakenly referencing the mod collections for the synth armor chest pieces instead of those for the raider armor chest pieces (Bug #25311).</li>
<li>Added a "null mod" for ballistic weave and a corresponding construction recipe, to allow the player to remove ballistic weave mods from clothing items. Some vanilla object templates have a null mod specified already but this never worked because that mod is set up to attach to a different slot (Bug #20496).</li>
<li>LL_Armor_Wastelander_Combined mistakenly returned two armors and a hat instead of selecting from the armors and combining the result with the hat (Bug #25332).</li>
<li>DLC04_PA_Material_Placeholder: Invalidated the duplicated T-51 Sugar Bombs paint job by removing its mod association keywords, so it will no longer be listed twice in the workbench menu. Items that have this mod attached already will remain unaffected (Bug #23662).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Lexington Garage: Fixed a navmesh gap and improved some navmesh sections that were buried below huge dirt piles (Bug #20323).</li>
<li>Medford Memorial Hospital: Fixed a bad navmesh section in a doorway and corrected a couple of vertices that were floating too far above the ground (#20415).</li>
<li>Ownership issues arising when the player decides to oppose Dr Chambers in MS17 (The Human Error) are now solved by adding the player to CovenantFaction once he gains control of the workshop. If siding with Dr Chambers, MS17 adds him to that faction anyway, but the quest can't do that in the other case because it shuts down before the player returns to Covenant and no one at Covenant would turn hostile if it did (Bug #20184).</li>
<li>Once the Covenant workshop is owned by the player, the doors 00020371, 000E0514, 000E0516, 000E053F, 000E0540, 000E5880 that are scripted to get relocked on reload are now swapped for non-scripted versions that do not require a key. The script that handles this swap will also disable the triggers 000786FB, 000786FC, 000786FD, 00078705, 00078718, 000E92A2 that are scripted to close the aforementioned doors once they have been opened (Bug #20369).</li>
<li>The two generic settlers (CovenantGenericF01, CovenantGenericM01) have been included in the cleanup procedure that handles disabling of the dead bodies after MS17 (Human Error) has stopped running (Bug #24468).</li>
<li>The turrets at Covenant will now be disabled on unload after they have been destroyed. Using them as workshop turrets is not possible because they are missing the scripts and all other prerequisites to make this work, so they would never add to the defense rating and could not be repaired. To give the player a reason to destroy them, their aggression and confidence data were set to aggressive and foolhardy (like all other turrets in the game), so they will attack now as one would expect it if the player fights the people at Covenant (Bug #20368).</li>
<li>Spectacle Island: The preplaced dead corpses will now be disabled when the area unloads for the first time after the player has gained control of the workshop (Bug #25297).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LS_WeaponsWorkbench01: Fixed the position of a glue bottle that was clipping with a metal case (Meshes\SCOL\Fallout4.esm\CM0022B988.nif) (Bug #23294).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>One of Mark Summerset's dialogue lines (0016C7F2) was not properly checking to make sure the player is wearing a vault suit. (Bug #25239)</li>
<li>RETravelKMK03, RETravelKMK05: These quests were missing checks to prevent them from running again after the actors they made appear in roadside encounters (Smiling Larry and The Scribe) were recruited by the player (Bug #20656).</li>
<li>DialogueDiamondCity: Solomon's dialogue topics on mutated fern were mistakenly checking whether the start stage of FFDiamondCity03 was completed but this stage was never set when the player already had a fern in his inventory when Solomon asked him for mutated fern for the first time (Bug #20272).</li>
<li>RETravelSC02: Fixed an issue with the startup of this quest where manipulation of a reference in a quest alias could fail because it was done in a fragment that was running while the quest was still being initialized (Bug #23698). [NR]</li>
<li>Min02, Min03: Missing properties added (Bug #23653).</li>
<li>Min03 (Old Guns): The quest will now advance also if Sarge is deactivated with the robotics expert perk rather than killed (Bug #24121) [NR].</li>
<li>Min01: Missing properties added (Bug #23307).</li>
<li>Companions will no longer comment about mirelurk hatchlings and hermit crab spawn as if they were radroaches (Bug #19729).</li>
<li>DogmeatQuest: Invalid property removed from topic info fragment TIF_DogmeatQuest_001AB268 (Bug #23358).</li>
<li>InstM01: Removed an invalid property (Bug #25412).</li>
<li>Inst302: Corrected a quest property that was erroneously pointing to a mirelurk nest pile (Bug #25347).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastle: Cleared a flag on the attacker collection alias script that resulted in the quest trying to track death counts with the help of REScript which MinDefendCastleScript extends, although the quest has not been designed to do it that way and is also missing all other script properties needed to make this work at all. As a result, the scripts ran superfluous code and spilled an error every time an attacker was killed (Bug #25417) [NR].</li>
<li>Inst301: Added a missing property and corrected an invalid one (Bugs #25348, #25349).</li>
<li>InstR03NEW: Removed an invalid property (Bug #25414).</li>
<li>InstR05: Corrected two invalid properties (Bug #25346).</li>
<li>FFGoodneighbor08: Fixed several issues with this quest's shut down (Bug #23228) [NR].</li>
<li>REObjectRO3: Fixed an issue with the startup of this quest where starting a scene could fail because the start call came from a fragment that was running while the quest was still being initialized (Bug #23738).</li>
<li>DLC01MQ02: Removed a line from the stage 2800 fragment that tried to complete a non-existing objective (Bug #23268).</li>
<li>DN092: Added checks to scene fragment SF_DN092_BossTauntScene_0001F68D to prevent it from trying to initiate combat with dead actors (Bug #23370).</li>
<li>FFDiamondCity10: Added a line to the quest script to remove ownership of the door to the mayor's office, so it will no longer be considered a crime to open the door to confront McDonough (Bug #23864) [NR].</li>
<li>FFDiamondCity12: Fixed an issue where this quest tried to set a stage on an event-scoped quest without previously checking whether it was even running (Bug #23091).</li>
<li>MQ102: Removed a line from the stage 55 fragment that tried to complete a non-existing objective (Bug #23368).</li>
<li>RRR01b: Removed a line from the stage 100 fragment that never worked and always threw an error because the reference it tried to enable is always in a container when this fragment runs (Bug #24550).</li>
<li>RRR03: Compiled an OnLocationChange event that lived on the quest fragment script but was not part of any fragment down to a stub because it never worked. It was also not needed because it was supposed to shut down the quest when a specific stage was set but that stage stopped the quest anyway (Bug #25161).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LightbulbOnOffScript: This script is handling animated light sources but also runs on objects that are not animated at all. As had to be expected, those references are permanently spilling errors because all animation-related script operations fail on them. Added a property that allows the script to discern whether the object it's running on is animated or not and to skip all animation-related operations if it's not. Set this to 'true' by default and changed it to 'false' on PlayerHouse_Lamp01Off because this is the only unanimated object this script is running on (Bug #24769).</li>
<li>AssaultronHeadModScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25206).</li>
<li>BloodbugScript: This script controls the bloodbugs' blood sacks but was mistakenly using the actor value for the bloodbugs' legs to do this. Also fixed an issue where the script forgot to re-register for animation events on reload and a badly constructed condition check that could result in casting a spell while there was no target around (Bug #25160).</li>
<li>BoSM01DistressPulserAliasScript: Added a check to skip some operations if the pulser is in a container, as they would fail otherwise (Bug #24191).</li> Also added some code to disable the corresponding transmitter if the pulser is scrapped at a workshop (Bug #20314) [NR].</li>
<li>COMDeaconScript: Added numerous missing sanity checks (Bug #25146).</li>
<li>CompanionActorScript: Added checks to prevent this script from trying to initialize and update affinity data for workbench-built robots, since these are missing all properties to handle this (Bug #22122). This will also stop the log spam from Ada (Bug #25194).</li>
<li>CryoCorpseScript: Check added to prevent this script from running on disabled references (Bug #22275).</li>
<li>DefaultCollectionAlias: Modified this script to work around an engine bug that may turn zero length arrays into none arrays upon reload (Bug #23739).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_EyebotSelfDestructScript, RobotSelfDestructScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effects these scripts are running on expire. Also added a check for invalid soundIDs to DLC01:DLC01_EyebotSelfDestruct Script (Bug #25204).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_MechanistDoorControlScript: modified this script to avoid unnecessary script activity and animation graph errors (Bug #24653).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_MechanistDoorScript: improved 3D checking (Bug #24653).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_TrackSystemMachine: Added various sanity checks and fixed an issue where this script forgot to save the ref of a spawned object in the corresponding script variable (Bug #25199).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_Dispatcher: Added a few lines of code to make sure that an array is properly initialized before this script tries to add elements to it (Bug #25211).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_LaserTripwireScript: Added a check to prevent this script from disarming traps that were disarmed already as this only resulted in unnecessary script activity and a wall of animation graph errors on the papyrus log (Bug #25201).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01MQ00Script: If DLC01 was running from game start, this script was failing its initialization because it tried to access the workshops array on WorkshopParentScript before the workshops had been initialized. It will now wait for stage 20 to be set on WorkshopParent quest (this stage is set once the workshop initialization is complete) before it starts running its own initialization functions (Bug #23355).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01SentryBotOverheatFXScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25205).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03BoatAnimScript: Modified this script to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #23909).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03MQ02FightQuestScript: Corrected a line that tried to remove a 'none' from an alias but actually wanted to remove a reference that is not an actor. Also fixed a threading issue that led to errors because an external script was removing references from an alias collection while this script was looping through it. The latter fix also required a modification to DLC03:DLC03_MultiCounterAliasColIncOnDeath (Bug #23912).</li>
<li>DLC03:FarHarborFF02CondenserScript, DLC03:FarHarborFF02Condenser02Script, DLC03:DLC03FarHarborFF02Condenser03Script: Modified these scripts to stay inactive once the refs they're running on have been disabled. At this point in the game, these refs are no longer needed but the scripts superfluously continued to run their OnLoad and OnUnload events. The modifications also fix animation graph errors (Bug #23915).</li>
<li>DLC03:TrapBear: Fixed an issue where the script changed states too slowly to effectively skip trigger events while a previous event was still being handled (#24385).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04HubFF01PlayerAliasScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23352).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04HubTradersLoseCollars: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23353).</li>
<li>DLC05:WeaponRackScript: Fixed a thread lock (Bug #2533).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: Added a check to bail out if this script is called before its terminal property has been initialized, as it would otherwise fail all of its operations (Bug #23381). Also improved the UFO4P 2.0.5 fix for certain companions being displayed before the player even met them (Bug #24636).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06OverseerHandlerScript: This script had to be substantially modified to fix some major bugs:
 <ul>
  <li>The terminal could operate on invalid data, because it could access the workshop data at any time. To avoid this, the sensitive terminal functions will no longer be displayed now until the workshop reset has finished running.</li>
  <li>Due to wrong syntax in a condition check, the assignment of settlers to guard duty or farming never worked.</li>
  <li>Even with that check fixed, the terminal would not have properly completed the assignment tasks because the game interpreted the terminal access as the player leaving the workshop, and all checks for the workshop being loaded returned false while the terminal was used. Consequently, the scripts did never update the workshop ratings to reflect the terminal operations because workshop resource recalculations are not possible if a workshop is not loaded. This is usually corrected by subsequent workshop resets, but in the meantime, the player would potentially be left with wrong workshop resource data.</li>
  <li>The terminal did never clear its workshop data. This made a very large number of references needlessly persistent and also could cause problems down the line when any of these objects was scrapped.</li>
 </ul>
<li>DN015PuzzleScript: Added a check to prevent this script from trying to evaluate text replacement data for missing samples (Bug #21917).</li>
<li>DN017QuestScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23491).</li>
<li>DN029CannonMasterScript: Added a tracking bool to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24175).</li>
<li>DN079_CanneryLidScript: Compiled the OnCellAttach() event down to a stub because it always tried to move the lid into a position it was already in. The only noticeable effect of this operation was a wall of errors on the papyrus log (Bug #23255).</li>
<li>DN131_SwanAliasScript: Checks added to prevent this script from moving Swan while he has no 3D or his parent cell is not attached, since this would fail with errors otherwise (Bug #22274).</li>
<li>DN158SubDoorLightController: Added several checks to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24492).</li>
<li>ElevatorMasterScript: Added five missing checks for valid sound instances (Bug #25218).</li>
<li>EMSystemTurfScript: improved 3D checking (Bug #24090).</li>
<li>FireFightStall_ActorScript: Check added to prevent this script from trying to enable deleted actors (Bug #23768).</li>
<li>FollowersScript: added some code to the SetAutonomy() function to clear the object array once it is overflowing and to log the objects that are potentially causing this issue (Bug #23394).</li>
<li>Hardcore:HC_JetUseScript: Added a check to prevent this script from calling the hardcore manager while survival mode is not turned on (Bug #23952).</li>
<li>IDCardReaderScript: Added a tracking bool to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24045).</li>
<li>Inst301Script: Corrected two off-by-one errors (Bug #25344).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastleAttackScript: Fixed an inappropriate check for the length of an array that always resulted in an error being thrown (Bug #25418).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastleScript: Added empty event handlers to avoid errors during the initialization of the MinDefendCastle quest (Bug #25416).</li>
<li>MirelurkHatchableScript: Modified this script to disallow handling of OnActivate events while a previous activation is still being processed, as this did result in errors being thrown. Also fixed an infinite reset loop issue (Bug #22299).</li>
<li>MQ101KelloggSequenceScript: Missing 3D check added (Bug #25303).</li>
<li>MQ101RadScannerTriggerScript: Modified this script to disallow animation calls while the references controlled by this script are still busy animating, since they would otherwise fail and throw errors (Bug #23350).</li>
<li>MQ203BabyScript: Fixed an issue with animation graph errors that were caused by conflicting animation calls from this script and MQ203Script (Bug #25305).</li>
<li>MQ203Script: Added numerous checks to prevent this script from running operations on disabled actors and calling animations on disabled references (Bug #25214).</li>
<li>MrHandyFXScript: Added a check to bail out if the effect this script is running on expires (Bug #24193).</li>
<li>MrHandyScript: Missing 3D checks added (Bug #24652).</li>
<li>TrapThistleScript: Removed a line that tried to delete a reference that is deleted by the engine already before the script gets to this point (Bug #23367).</li>
<li>TrapTrigPlate: Removed a line from this script that could lead to unnecessary recursions of the functions that handle the trigger events (Bug #23578).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript:
 <ul>
  <li>The ProduceFood() function has been rewritten again to use a new algorithm that is significantly faster than the vanilla one (Bug #24735).</li>
  <li>A bug in the object unassignment procedures was fixed that could result in objects that exceeded an actor's allowed production limit being not properly unassigned (Bug #25439).</li>
  <li>Improvements to the resource assignment procedures (Bugs #25483, #25264).</li>
  <li>Improvements to the code that handles unassignment of actors from unloaded workshops (Bug #25238).</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where objects were not properly unassigned from settlers that were sent to another workshop (Bug #25237).</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the workshop reset did not start running as expected when returning to a workshop after a previous reset was stopped prematurely (Bug #25221).</li>
 </ul>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopObjectScript: ongoing performance improvements (Bug #25215).</li>
<li>WorkshopResourceScannerScript: Added 3D checks (Bug #24091).</li>
<li>WorkshopScript: Added a check to prevent this script from passing invalid actors to WorkshopParentScript (Bug #25195).</li>
<li>WorkshopTutorialScript: Due to an inappropriate condition check, the "Damaged Object Tutorial" could be started for objects which the player cannot repair and would then never stop to display the "Repair a damaged object" message until the player entered menu mode at a different workshop and started activities that resulted in workshop events being sent (Bug #25243).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>NativeSpotlightTerminal, NativeTurretTerminal: added checks to prevent the spotlight or turret control menus from being displayed on terminals with no spotlights or turrets linked (Bug #20518).</li>
<li>HackerTurretHolotapeSubMenu: The 'Override Alliance Parameters' option on this terminal adds text replacement data that apparently survive cell resets. As a result, previously hacked terminals may display wrong alliance data if the player returns after their cell has reset. The script also may change faction ownership on individual turrets and these changes are known to survive cell resets too. To solve this, a helper quest has been added to store the data from hacked terminals. The terminal script will pass the turret data to that quest before it modifies them, and the quest will restore them once the terminal resets (Bug #22567).</li>
<li>DN006_BossTerminal: Added a missing property and removed an invalid one (Bug #23767).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair_ENT_DeconControlTerminal_ArchControlSubTerminal: Invalid property removed from fragment TERM_DLC01LairENT_DeconHallC_01008B17 (Bug #25200).</li>
<li>TERM_DN083_SubTerminalPassword: Missing sanity checks added (Bug #23317).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>01000D79: Removed two scripts from this reference that were supposed to manipulate a linked reference which does not exist (Bug #24949).</li>
<li>001A75C1: Turret missing a link to the terminal it's visually connected to (Bug #22394).</li>
<li>00184437: Load door mistakenly set as owned by Nick Valentine (Bug #23627).</li>
<li>00212A20, 0021FD4B, 0023954D, 00249097: Duplicated or otherwise obsolete triggers that have been permanently disabled (Bug #25182).</li>
<li>000E4D9D: A trigger used as marker by an AI package, but with a script running that tries to manipulate a linked reference which does not exist. To avoid log spam, the unused script has been removed (Bug #25182).</li>
<li>0012B940: This trigger was supposed to disable two leveled deathclaws to prevent them from being seen floating on the sides of a building west of Faneuil Hall, but this never worked because the links were set up backwards. This fix also required a modification to DefaultEnableDisableTrigScript because it could not handle more than one linked ref per trigger (Bug #21908).</li>
<li>0013038C: A bathroom scale trap that was placed a bit too deep underwater to allow for an activation. Increased its size a little, so as to raise the trigger surface above the water plane (Bug #23752).</li>
<li>00183281, 0018328C: Properties modified on AttractionObjectScript to avoid errors if the script tries to enable or disable these references (Bug #25203).</li>
<li>0023D713: Sleeping bag in the same place as a mattress from a random encounter spot. The sleeping bag will now remain disabled while the mattress is enabled (Bug #23646).</li>
<li>00019B16: Disabled this trigger as it is running a script that tries to start a non-existing scene (Bug #23857).</li>
<li>001A583E: A bed at Covenant that was unusable by settlers because it was missing its WorkshopObjectScript (Bug #24951). [NR]</li>
<li>00222E9F, 00222EA0: Protectron and its pod in Lexington Garage moved to avoid clipping with a bollard that pushed the unconscious protectron out of the pod. Also updated the navmesh to account for these changes (Bug #20323).</li>
<li>Added a wall piece to cover a gap between walls 0178A1F and 0178A2A (Bug #23642).</li>
<li>0022F7BF: Misplaced robot corpse. (Bug #20449)</li>
<li>07004C58, 07004C59, 07004C5A: Rock mounds placed to cover gaps between ceiling pieces. (Bug #23687)</li>
<li>07015DAA, 07015DAB, 07015DAC: Trash clumps placed underneath a floating tire pile. (Bug #23839)</li>

<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>

<li>MS10_RadioTowerNote: Property not set on the book record, resulting in an error when trying to add a map marker.

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Echo Lake Lumber Mill was not set with the Far Harbor world location as its parent. This could lead to incorrectly assigned radiant quests that should go to the Commonwealth instead. It may also have played a part in settlers leaving for Dalton Farm at random times. (Bug #24586)</li>
<li>Dunwich Borers was not correctly flagged as part of its own location. At the same time, Hugo's Hole nearby was mistakenly flagged as being part of the Dunwich Borers location. (Bug #24668)</li>

<b><u>Quest Fixes</u></b>

<li>It should no longer be possible for PAM to give out Railroad radiant quests if she's been reprogrammed for the Brotherhood of Steel. (Bug #20000)</li>
<li>Invald properties on DN053 have been removed or corrected. (Bug #24909)</li>
<li>Emogene Takes a Lover (MS09Mission02) was possible to get stuck because the aliases in The Secret of Cabot House (MS09) were not marked to allow reservations, which was blocking her from filling the required alias. All 3 of her aliases (why she has 3, who knows) have been marked to allow reserved so that this quest will no longer get itself stuck. (Bug #24814) [NR]</li>
<li>The above fix in 24814 also resolved a scripting error that comes up in MS09 when Emogene is being moved to the amphitheater. (Bug #24774) [NR]</li>
<li>In Atom Cats Garage (DN054) Zeke has 4 AI packages that have script records attached but the script files themselves don't exist, and apparently never did. (Bug #24759)</li>
<li>Corrected an invalid alias property in DLC01LairJB. (Bug #24669)</li>
<li>During Long Road Ahead (COMMacCreadyQuest) when you are told to take MacCready to Med-Tek Research, no quest marker is added to show where the location is despite him telling you where to find it. (Bug #24926)</li>
<li>DN119Fight: The second scavenger in the Rotten Landfill site encounter did never attack the mole rats because his alias was not registered on DN119FightController script (Bug #25130).</li>
<li>MQ206: Null pointer property corrected (Bug #24617).</li>
<li>The player should no longer be able to tell Dima they are a member of the Brotherhood of Steel if they have not actually joined yet. (Bug #25030)</li>
<li>COMCaitQuest: Once started, this quest could advance up to stage 50 without Cait being anywhere around, because an event and several triggers did not run a follower check. This fix also required modifications to DefaultQuestChange LocationScript (Bug #24694).</li>
<li>DLC01FortHagenSatelliteArray: Added a klaxon that was expected by this quest, but did not exist, to Fort Hagen satellite array and pointed the respective quest property to the new object (Bug #24547).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair: Flagged an alias collection as optional, so the quest script can clear it (Bug #25144).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair: Fixed calls to several doors in the stage 200 fragment as they didn't work if these doors were not loaded, and modified DLC01Lair_SecurityDoorLightScript to skip calls of an unsafe workaround in the stage 201 fragment that caused threading issues on the door scripts and performance issues because all safety lights did needlessly try to open all of the doors on every cell reload (Bug #24675).</li>
<li>DN083_Barney: invalid quest objective corrected on topic info fragment TIF_DN083_Barney_001243EA (Bug #24580).</li>

<li>MS11: Missing checks for valid sound IDs added to the stage 1399 fragment (Bug #24621).</li>
<li>MS16: Removed several lines from the stage 65 fragment that were referencing a non-existing objective. Also fixed several errors in the stage 18 and stage 200 fragments (Bugs #24836 and #24837).</li>
<li>RR102: Modified the quest script to set a bool property on an elevator instead of trying to manipulate it directly, which never worked because the elevator is not loaded while the respective fragments are running (Bug #24634).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>GenericBrawlAlliesScript, GenericBrawlPlayerScript, GenericBrawlOpponentAliasScript, MS13IntroBrawlAliasScript: Prevented "magic" effects from causing brawls to turn into real fights. Should eliminate problems from a few of the DLC effects. (Bug #24817)</li>
<li>QF_DN054_00048516: Script attempts to remove alias data from a reference after it's already been cleared from the alias. Obviously this cannot be done. (Bug #24761)</li>
<li>QF_RRR04_000B26C2: Attempting to set a persist location on a non-created reference (Bug #24971)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: If a NONE is passed to the DisarmTrigger function, several errors are set off because of a lack of sanity checking. Automatron intentionally sends a NONE for several references using this script via DLC01:DLC01Lair_LaserTripwireScript. (Bug #24679)</li>
<li>BugSwarmFXScript: Moved a function call out of the OnInit event since that function would fail to run if OnInit fired before cell attach (Bug #24771).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_TrackSystemTrapElectricArc: fixed an issue where this script failed to avaluate a target because trigger events running at the same time were modifying the array the target evaluation was running on (Bug #24676).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01LairQuestScript fixed an issue where the MBattle_Phase2_Dispatch1230() function passed an invalid argument that caused array index out of range errors down the line (Bug #24677).</li>
<li>MQ206Script: check added to prevent this script from trying to complete non-existing objectives (Bug #24620).</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: removed a superfluous call of the HandleDestruction() function (Bug #24642).</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: this script did not properly initialize and update the actor value that controls the flora harvest time. As a result, crops could regrow faster than intended, and destroyed crops could regrow immediately after their repair (Bug #24775).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: removed a superfluous check for caravan actors from the AssignObjectToWorkshop() function that was left from test runs on the UFO4P 2.0.4 modifications (Bug #24596).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: added safety measures to circumvent an engine issue that causes zero-length arrays to turn into none arrays on reload. As a result, object assignment procedures could temporarily break at a workshop if a save made at that workshop was reloaded (Bug #24603).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: auto assignment of actors to unassigned resource objects should not run on Dogmeat (Bug #24638).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: fixed a threading issue with the processing of custom workshop events that could result in quests listening to those events (e.g. minutemen quests) advancing prematurely or not progressing at all if two or more of these quests were active at the same time (Bug #24650).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopObjectScript: further modifications to improve performance (Bug #24637).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopScript: improved the cleanup procedures for work objects of actors that were unassigned while a workshop was not loaded, including support for sending custom workshop events (Bug #25129).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopEventsQuestScript: improved the processing of custom workshop events to limit the number of calls of event handling functions on WorkshopParentScript and thus save performance (Bug #25128).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_SecurityDoorLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24654).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_RobotLiftLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24670).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01LairQuestScript: Fixed an off-by-one error in the CleanupDungeon() function (Bug #24671).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01RadiantQuestScript: Fixed an issue where Enable() and AddItem() were called in the wrong order (Bug #24536).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: Fixed an issue where this script used a wrong message object for text replacement (Bug #24636).</li>
<li>Default2StateActivator: Further modifications were needed to handle cases where a door can be activated by a reference in another cell (i.e. if OnActivate fires while the door is not loaded) (Bug #25149).</li>
<li>DN051_DelayedAmbushScript: Added checks to bail out after losing the reference of the actor this script is supposed to run on. This appears to happen if that actor is desintegrated (Bug #24428).</li>
<li>ElevatorMasterScript: Added a hidden property and some code to allow external scripts for making an elevator non-funtional even if the reference is in an unloaded area (Bug #24634).</li>
<li>FallingRocksandDustActivatorScript: Check added to skip trigger events while a previous event is still running, as this led to animations being called out of order and errors being thrown (Bug #24425).</li>
<li>FusionGeneratorSCRIPT: Added sanity checks for missing linked lights because some generators in the game are missing them inentionally (Bug #24548).</li>
<li>GlowingKlaxonLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors, and added a check to prevent the script from trying to animate disabled references (Bug #24534).</li>
<li>LegendaryArmorMagicEffectDisarmScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #24614).</li>
<li>RR101CenterActivator: Removed a line that tried to access a non-existing object (Bug #24633).</li>
<li>ToggleButtonScript: Check added to handle conflicting calls from external scripts. Also imrpoved 3D checking (Bug #23232).</li>
<li>TrapBase: Check added to prevent this script from running on disabled traps (Bug #23933).</li>
<li>TrapBreakableWalkway: Added sanity checks for a missing linked reference since there is at least one trap existing in the game that is intentionally missing this reference (Bug #24616).</li>
<li>VertibirdTurretScript: fixed an issue where one function could clear a reference while another function was trying to run operations on it (Bug #24433).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Invalid properties removed from DN070_HolotapeCarlTerminal. (Bug #24691)</li>

<p class="h">v2.0.4 (2018-05-26)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>

<b><u>Effect Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Sabotaging turrets would routinely fail due to the controlling effect being marked as a spell instead of an ability. (Bug #24248)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Violent (mod_Legendary_Weapon_DamageLimbRecoil) is described as giving 25% to damage and limb damage but is actually set to give 30 limb damage. This should have been set to 25 as the description calls for. (Bug #24339)</li>
<li>Reduced the weight of Tato Flowers (TatoWild) from 0.5 to 0.1 units to be consistent with other flowers and blossoms in the game. (Bug #23923)</li>
<li>Two versions of the Vault 88 Jumpsuit (DLC06Armor_Vault88_UnderwearClean, DLC06Armor_Vault88_Underwear_Dirty) have no value. This is inconsistent with all others in the game which have a value of 20. (Bug #23969)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fruit would not disappear when harvesting wild mutfruit. (meshes\landscape\plants\FloraMutFruit02Wild.nif) (Bug #24337)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Quest Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Father's speech during Institutionalized (MQ207) will claim you got help from the wrong faction to teleport into the Institute. This should now be corrected to check to see who actually helped you teleport in, not just which factions you may have joined as tokens early in the game. (Bug #24406)</li>
<li>At the end of Duty or Dishonor (BoSM02, BoSM02Postquest) the game needs to determine what to do with Clarke. It appears as though making a GetRef() call during the stage that is starting the quest can result in the call failing and passing a None along to the remainder of the fragment. This then results in several failures in dealing with where to move Clarke to. An added timer event should prevent this from happening again but obviously cannot fix things if this part of the game has already been completed. (Bug #24383)</li>
<li>Incorrect dialogue conditions allowed two female responses in the male branch during Piper's interview with the player in Diamond City. (Bug #24178)</li>
<li>After killing the corsair in Hunting the Hunter (DLC03AcadiaM02) every NPC the player tries to speak to will result in the player simply saying "Hey, Dejen" until the quest is completed. The greeting in the quest needed a target to make sure that prompt only ran when the NPC is Dejen. (Bug #24096)</li>
<li>Diamond City Security officers would sometimes comment about it being a "nice night" during the daytime due to an incorrect condition check on a dialogue topic. (Bug #23818)</li>
<li>BoS201: removed several lines from the quest script that referenced non-existing objectives on this and other quests. (Bugs #24024, #24434)</li>
<li>BoS201: removed a line that tried to enable an enable-parented guard whose enable parent was already enabled by an earlier running stage of this quest. (Bug #24356)</li>
<li>BoS201: added a line to the stop stage fragment to remove BoS201RadioScene from the scene array on DNMasterQuest, in order to avoid log spam from RadioFailsafeScript. (Bug #24055)</li>
<li>BoS201: added a line to the scene fragment SF_BoS201_02_VertibirdFlight_00121F31 to wait for 3D before calling an animation on the Prydwen's vertibird perch. (Bug #24126)</li>
<li>BoS201, MQ106: fixed an issue with a door inside Fort Hagen which MQ106 tried to open after BoS201 disabled it. This door will now be handled by MQ106. The line to disable it has been removed from the script of BoS201. (Bug #24039)</li>
<li>BoSEnable: fixed issues with animation graph errors thrown by two doors at Boston Airport which this quest tried to open while the player was at Fort Hagen. Also removed a line that tried to enable an enable-parented ref whose parent was already enabled by an earlier stage of this quest. (Bug #24021)</li>
<li>BoSM00: null pointer property corrected on scene fragment SF_BoSM00_Kells_Intro_Initia_00142F87. (Bug #24381)</li>
<li>BoSM02: corrected three null pointer properties. (Bug #24374)</li>
<li>BoSR03: fixed an issue where a quest fragment could set the stop stage before it had finished all operations on the quest aliases. (Bug #24475)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ00: removed invalid properties and restored missing ones. (Bug #23356)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ01: script property modified to point to an enable marker instead of to a ref that is enable-parented to that marker. (Bug #23911)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ02Fight: several quest aliases flagged as optional so the quest script can clear them. (Bug #23914)</li>
<li>DN015: missing property added on scene fragment SF_DN015_RewardScene_0002CC45. (Bug #23989)</li>
<li>DN033: several quest aliases flagged as optional so the quest script can clear them. (Bug #23932)</li>

<li>FFDiamondCityWanted04: invalid script properties removed. (Bug #23901)</li>
<li>MinRecruit02: invalid property removed from topic info fragment TIF_MinutemenCentralQuest_000A02BC. (Bug #23802)</li>
<li>MQ106Investigations: added a script property for a can trap (refID 00137C61) that was mistakenly enable-parented to MQ106InvestigationItemsMarker (this left the trap non-functional), unlinked the trap from the marker, and added a line to the quest script to enable the trap separately. (Bug #24016)</li>
<li>MQ201: null pointer property corrected. (Bug #24022)</li>
<li>MS01: object reference property mistakenly pointing to a random encounter quest. Also corrected a null pointer property. (Bug #24093)</li>
<li>MS01: corrected a quest stage fragment that referenced the wrong objective on quest MS01MiscObj. (Bug #24495)</li>
<li>MS02: corrected three quest stage fragments that referenced a non-existing objective. (Bug #24476)</li>
<li>MS10b: the trigger alias on this quest could be filled with a leveled supermutant because the trigger's LocRefType was not unique. Which reference ended up in the alias at quest start was entirely random. (Bug #24115)</li>
<li>MS10b: removed two superfluous animation calls on the power lift doors that always failed with animation graph errors because the doors had already been moved in the correct position by DN161PowerLiftButton script. (Bug #24116)</li>
<li>MS11: added a missing sound property. (Bug #24418)</li>
<li>REAssaultKMK_MQ101: an encounter with named feral ghouls that should not have been repeatable. (Bug #24012)</li>

<li>The alias for the Vault-Tec Rep was not set to protected status on WorkshopParent. (Bug #24488)</li>
<li>Several of X6-88's idle comments were referencing the wrong target for gender specific dialogue checks. (Bug #23930)</li>
<li>Living on the Edge (DLC03FarHarborM02) tries to set invalid objectives during the quest. (Bug #23913)</li>
<li>To the Mattresses (RRR08) is missing the sound for completing the quest, and two dialogues are missing conditions for the status of the quest when completed. (Bug #24310)</li>
<li>Erikson uses incorrect dialogue for the player when Longfellow is with you due to the gender check being done on Erikson instead of the player. (Bug #24351)</li>
<li>WorkshopSynthInfiltrator01: this quest could not be completed due to the infiltrators never becoming hostile because the quest cleared their alias before a subsequent stage could update their faction relationships. (Bug #24539)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>WorkshopSynthAttackScript: was missing a check for the quest this script was called from, which resulted in leaving the player only one game hour to react after the attack notification had been displayed. (Bug #24537)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: No check for validity of the companion alias before doing distance calculations on them. (Bug #24424)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: AddItem will remove the reference from its existing container before putting it in the new one. The line prior to the call moving the Deathclaw egg back into the nest has been commented out as it is not needed. (Bug #24423)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: Several stages attempting to complete Objective 100, which does not exist. (Bug #24422)</li>
<li>AttractionObjectScript: corrected a check for deleted references in the OnLoad() event to bail out if a reference is deleted instead of continuing to process the event which then started to throw errors. (Bug #24413)</li>
<li>BehemothSlamsFXScript: checks added to prevent the script from running after the magic effect has expired. (Bug #20619)</li>
<li>BirdCritterScript: further modifications to reduce glitches with birds and to improve performance. (#24367)</li>
<li>BoS302_DisableFastTravelTrigger: missing sanity check. (Bug #23860)</li>
<li>BoSKellsPAScript: did not check whether the parent quest was running before it tried to start a scene. (Bug #24372)</li>
<li>BoSVBAliasBoardingScript: missing a check for a non-existing passenger alias, since at least one of the quests that have this script attached to a vertibird alias handle the boarding procedure on a separate script and do not have a passenger alias. (Bug #24357)</li>
<li>DefaultClearLocationOnTriggerScript: added a bool property to specify whether the trigger should disable itself after the script has run because some triggers running this script have their enable state controlled by enable parents. (Bug #24415)</li>
<li>DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad: corrections made to prevent this script from trying to run operations on deleted references. (Bug #24194)</li>
<li>DefaultStartSceneOnActivate: did not check whether the parent quest was running before it tried to start a scene. (Bug #24278)</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_CompanionSelfDestructScript: OnInit() event missing a line to initialize a script property. Also added a check for a valid soundID. (Bug #23749)</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06OverseerHandlerScript: sanity check missing for cases where script functions are called without a terminal reference passed in, e.g. during quest initialization. (Bug #23351)</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: sanity check for 'none' actors missing. (Bug #23621)</li>
<li>DLC06:WorkshopAutoRepairScript: fixed an issue that caused massive log spam if the vault workshop DLC was installed at game start because the script tried to access data on WorkshopParentScript before they had been initialized. (Bug #23075)</li>

<li>LoadElevatorPanelScript: 3D check missing. (Bug #24355)</li>
<li>MagazineRackContainerScript: 3D checks missing. (Bug #23856)</li>
<li>MirelurkHarvestableScript: corrected an issue that forced all refs with this script attached into an infinite reset loop because the script called Reset() in the OnReset() event. (#24370)</li>
<li>MQ106InvestgationDummySCRIPT: script property and condition check added to prevent the script from trying to add dead actors and various static objects to the player's inventory. To make this work, script properties had to be updated on the following refs: 00085339, 001342C7, 001342D7, 001342D8, 00137C61, 001476F2, 001476F7, 001476FC, 001476FE, 00147702, 00147704, 00147706, 00147707, 00148233, 0014A136, 00154AB4, 00156937. (Bugs #23756, #24017)</li>
<li>MQ203Script was causing log spam because it performed condition checks in the wrong order. (Bug #24486)</li>
<li>MS02InstallItem: added states to avoid more than one activation of the refs this script is attached to, since any subsequent activation failed with animation graph errors due to the animation sequence played upon activation not being repeatable. (Bug #24493)</li>
<li>OxygenTankScript: missing checks for valid soundID and to prevent it from trying to manipulate disabled references. (Bug #23579)</li>
<li>POISC12_RobotManagerScript: invalid target passed to the RegisterForHitEvent() function. (Bug #24060)</li>
<li>REAliasScript, RECollectionAliasScript: checks added to prevent them from calling functions on REParent script to kill actors that were dead already, since this did fail with an error most of the time. Also corrected a bad 3D check in the KillActor() function of REParent script. (Bug #20583)</li>
<li>REScript: checks added to skip cleanup events received while another cleanup event was being processed already or after the quest was shut down, since handling them could result in quests being restarted by setting the stop stage twice. (Bug #23269)</li>
<li>ShipmentScript: fixed an exploit that allowed to obtain unlimited scrap and made the script functional again since Bethesda had compiled it down to a stub. (Bug #24169)</li>
<li>SimpleElevatorMasterScript: more sanity checks added for missing linked refs because some of the objects controlled by that script are not elevators and thus do not possess all elevator parts. (Bug #24426)</li>
<li>SpotlightTriggerScript: fixed an issue that caused massive log spam because a function that was supposed to return a bool did not return anything due to a badly constructed condition check. (Bug #20876)</li>
<li>SpotlightTriggerScript: missing check for array indices out of range. (Bug #24056)</li>
<li>TrapBarnacle: removed a line that tried to delete a reference that is deleted by the engine already before the script gets to this point. (Bug #22216)</li>
<li>TrapBase: this script was not checking whether a trap was a physical trap before it called the TrapHitBase script which doesn't exist on traps that are not physical traps. (Bug #24220)</li>
<li>TrapGun: 3D checks missing in several places. (Bug #23606)</li>
<li>TrapGun: checks added to prevent the script from giving an XP reward if the gun is grabbed after the trap itself has been disarmed already or after the trap has fired. (Bug #23109)</li>
<li>TrapGun: check added to prevent the script from trying to fire the gun after it was grabbed. (Bug #24485)</li>
<li>TrapRadiationScript: sanity check missing to handle traps with no trigger sound specified. (Bug #24217)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: check added to prevent the script from running on a non-existing reference after the player reloaded a save made in the same area before the trap was triggered. (Bug #23613)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: 3D check missing for cases where a trap is rearmed by a call from an external script. Also added checks to avoid animation graph errors in the same situation. (Bugs #24058, #24484)</li>
<li>TunnelingRaceFX: checks added to prevent the script from running after the magic effect has expired. (Bug #23289)</li>
<li>WorkshopAttackScript: workshop attacks flagged as night attacks could be delayed for an overly long time because the script did not calculate an appropriate delay. This increased the risk of getting attack messages for two different workshops within a short period of time because the workshop scripts continue to check all workshops for attacks once per game day, irrespective of whether previously triggered attacks have actually started running or not. (Bug #24455)</li>
<li>WorkshopAttackScript, WorkshopParentScript: improved the reset handling for workshops under attack. (Bug #24503)</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: sanity check added to handle rare cases where the script tried to enable a deleted reference because of events firing out of order. (Bug #23755)</li>
<li>WorkshopNPCScript: check added to prevent the script from running on a non-existing actor if the player reloaded a save made before that actor had been created. (Bug #24437)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: sanity checks added to the GetWorkshop() and UpdateActorsWorkObjects_Private() functions to handle cases where an invalid workshopID is passed in. (Bugs #23803, #23948)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: a further modification to the ProduceFood() function was necessary because the current version did not produce anything if WorkshopScript called it on a workshop that was never player owned. Also added a workaround for cases where the total food resource value is not equal to the sum of the individual food resource values, by normalizing the production chance values to the grand total. (Bug #23996)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript counted provisioners as unassigned. They are doing a job though and therefore should count as assigned. (Bug #24261)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: AddActorToWorkshop() called ClearFromOldLocations() only on actors that were tagged as synths, but this function should be called on all in-game created actors. (Bug #24262)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: there was a rare case where the script could assign a boss LocRefType to an actor who was subsequently removed from a workshop. (Bug #24263)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: removed some code from the UnassignActorFromObject() and UnassignActor() functions that was needlessly repeating operations that had been carried out already by previously called sub-functions. (Bug #24264)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: the UnassignObject() function did not properly update an actor's status if some, but not all of his work objects were unassigned. (Bug #24273)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: modified the SetUnassignedPopulationRating() function to accept an actor array, so the ResetWorkhop() function can pass its own actor array and doesn't have to rely on SetUnassignedPopulationRating() to create a new one. Otherwise, the operation would fail if the workshop had unloaded needlessly so because ResetWorkshop already had a valid actor array. (Bug #24274)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: due to inappropriate handling of damaged objects, it was possible that an actor could get more work objects assigned than allowed by his production limit. (Bug #24311)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: To improve performance, the ResetWorkshop() function and the "core functions" that handle actor and object assignment have been completely rewritten. Workshop resets are now 25% faster, on average, which is significant but admittedly only a minor improvement for overly large workshops. The resource assignment procedures however, which run in regular intervals while the player stays at a workshop and also are called every time a resource object is built are more than 90% faster now. This greatly helps in reducing the number of threads that are alive on WorkshopParentScript at the same time and makes script lag issues that could still occur after the reset had finished running less likely. This also required minor modifications to WorkshopScript and WorkshopObjectScript. (Bug #24312)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript assigned beds to robots. (Bug #24408)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: it was possible that workshop resets were queued if the player quickly fast traveled between workshops, and if they eventually started running, they would have run on workshops that were not loaded anymore. A check has been added to the ResetWorkshop() function to skip resets if the workshop they are supposed to run on is not loaded. (Bug #24411)</li>
<li>WorkshopScript, WorkshopParentScript: The location check performed by WorkshopScript before running a resource calculation had to be further improved because a bogus location may be returned for the player's current location if the player is in workshop mode. The improved check has also been applied to a function on WorkshopParentScript that checks whether the most recently visited workshop is still loaded. (Bug #24122)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement & Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The scrap recipe for certain pieces of wood furniture (workshop_co_ScrapFurnitureWood) erroneously specifies that 20 pieces of wood should be returned when it should only be 2 pieces. (Bug #24257)</li>
<li>Removed actor ownership from all pre-placed beds in settlements because it broke bed assignment by the workshop scripts. This affected Abernathy Farm, Finch Farm, The Slog and Warwick Homestead. (Bug #24531)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Invalid properties cleared from DN035_RobotControlTerminal_SelfDestruct. (Bug #24210)</li>
<li>DN033_Station1Terminal, DN039_SecurityTerminal: Terminals that were supposed to be allowing holotapes to be used but weren’t set to do so. (Bug #24432, Bug #23789)</li>
<li>East City Downs terminal was not configured to allow hacking even though it has linked turrets. (Bug #24230)</li>

<li>0021E02A: bool property on DefaultClearLocationOnTriggerScript set to 'false' to prevent this trigger from disabling itself after the script has run because its enable state is controlled by an enable parent. (Bug #24415</li>
<li>00129AF9: misplaced wall that left gaps on either side of it. Because that wall is in a precomb, another wall piece has been added to close both gaps. (Bug #23705)</li>
<li>00239A20: moved a tire that could end up floating once the road piece it was sitting on got disabled after the Institute had been blown up. (Bug #23829)</li>
<li>0003F2BF: leveled mirelurk with properties missing on AmbushArtFX script. (Bug #23988)</li>

(Bugs #23616, #23618)</li>
<li>0003C2FF, 0003C403, 000CAE32, 001322B4, 001E8119, 00204478, 00225E5E, 00225E84, 00225EBB: static objects with a DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad script attached. 001322B4 also had ragdoll data specified. Removed the script and the ragdoll data and also cleared the 'don't havok settle' flag. (Bug #23924)</li>

<li>0021973A: non-functioning spotlight (no trigger) duplicated in the place of a functioning spotlight. Both spotlights were sharing the same light, resulting in massive log spam. Unlinked the light from the non-functioning spotlight and disabled that spotlight. (Bug #24114)</li>
<li>00196357: unlinked this marker from its enable parent because the quest BoSPrydwenScene_FlightDeck is handling its enable state. (Bug #24127)</li>
<li>00182E34: the ElevatorMasterScript running on this reference failed to start two scenes because the respective script properties were locally flagged as 'removed'. Changed these flags to 'edited'. (Bug #24128)</li>

<li>Synth versus Synth (RESceneLC01) [aka Art vs Art] could be repeated infinitely regardless of how the encounter was resolved by the player - even if both Arts were dead. This was due to a tracking variable intended to prevent it from running more than once never being set when the quest terminates. (Bug #22526)</li>
<li>RETravelCT03: It was possible for Gus to be killed by NPCs and the player to be blamed for it happening, which resulted in Kat refusing to talk to the player. Gus is now a protected NPC so that only the player can kill him. (Bug #22521)</li>

<li>DLC04:AbPerkGhoulish04EffectScript: Corrected a division by zero error. (Bug #22367)</li>
<li>DLC04:AudioActorPlaySound: Missing 3D check for stopping sound instances. (Bug #22456)</li>
<li>DLC05:DLC05WorkshopElevatorScript: Elevator buttons vanish or end up misplaced and required a new cell load event to correct them when returning to the area. (Bug #20825)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Array index out of range error. (Bug #22514)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Corrections in the ProduceFood() function previously edited by UFO4P 2.0.1. (Bug #22841)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Further corrections to fix the failsafe object chosen for random crops. (Bug #22844)</li>

<li>AttractionObjectScript: Checking the wrong keyword for event processing. (Bug #22817)</li>
<li>MS07bPlayerSitScript: Compiled to a stub. This script was broken and also served no purpose as the quest had been written to do things a different way. (Bug #20971)</li>
<li>WorkshopScript: Bed ownership was not being adjusted when the player took over a settlement with preexisting beds. (Bug #21408)</li>
</ul>

<li>Far Harbor Survivalist (DLC03_FarHarborSurvivalistPerk) was not functional due to being flagged as a spell instead of an ablity. (Bug #22347)</li>
<li>Iron Fist level 5 should properly provide the paralysis effect while wearing power armor. Idle Anim MeleeAttackPerkParalyzingPalm required changing the animation event to point to a normal melee attack animation. Not the most ideal fix, but the loss of one unique animation sequence is less problematic than the perk simply not functioning or causing unrealistic teleportation to the target. (Bug #19673)</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed a crash in the Longfellow escort scene when it determined whether or not to proceed with the Trapper encounter or divert past it because they were already dead. Crash was caused by a freak incident of game data corruption due to fixing an unrelated record in the parent quest. (Bug #22462)</li>
<li>Fixed crashed caused by trying to disarm/trigger/shoot a laser tripwire when running on a new save game. An unforeseen scripting issue was to blame. (Bug #22463)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing clapping monkey traps to not function on the first time visit to a cell. A line needed to initialize them on cell load was commented out when it should not have been.</li>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>EncRaider06Melee was incorrectly given a strength value of 80 instead of 8. (Bug #22345)</li>
<li>Mirelurks used in various ambush scenarios were not being generated with their proper FX skins due to several errors in supporting formlists and scripts. (Bug #22164)</li>
<li>EncCurieRobot is not correctly set as female which can result in Curie failing gender checks for female NPCs even after she's in synth form. (Bug #21854)</li>
<li>Enraged Fog Crawler had a damage resist value that was incorrectly set to 4000. It should have been 400, which puts it in line with the progression for all the other lower level versions. (Bug #22315)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Effect Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>PowerArmorPerkEffect contained an erroneous null entry that was causing errors. The null record should instead point to a blank impact data set so it doesn't result in sound doubling. (Bug #20721)</li>
<li>PerkNerdRageSlowTime is missing required properties for the image space modifications the perk is supposed to do. (Bug #22114)</li>

<li>The Gatling Laser does not reload to proper capacity with various fusion core related perks active due to the max capacity setting being too low to handle it. (Bug #22322)</li>
<li>Happy Birthday Sweet Roll was not marked as a food item as it should be. (Bug #22091)</li>
<li>Improper types of oil and wood could show up in the Misc Items menu at a workshop due to the LL_Component_Wood and LL_Component_Oil lists referencing the wrong item for the components. (Bug #21595) [NR]</li>
<li>mod_DLC03_BroadHead erroneously associated with the 10mm Large Barrel mod, which then causes the loose mod object to stop working correctly. (Bug #22360)</li>
</ul>

<li>Cleared unused properties from RESceneCT07. (Bug #22277)</li>

<li>Random encounters for Ron Staples, Doc Anderson, and Trader Rylee (RECampKMK02, RECampKMK01, RECampKMK_DN079B) could still start up even after they'd been recruited because the script event manager was not properly respecting the alias requirements to allow these to start up. (Bug #22397)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlements & Workshops</u></b>
<ul>

</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>

</ul>

<b><u>Texture & Material Fixes</u></b>

<li>The Sound Keyword Mapping setting for Sentry Bot clusters (SentryBotClusterLauncher) was incorrectly pointing to the sound descriptor for the bomb explosion. (Bug #21326)</li>
<li>Holotapes should be classified as voice for UI purposes instead of effects. (Bug #21373)</li>
<li>Audio was missing for reloading both the .44 Revolver and Tommy Gun. The animations apparently had the right data but the game lacked sound descriptor records for them. (Bug #20263)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LCharFeralGhoul lacked the proper leveled list calculation flags which resulted in numerous generated encounters with them spawning everything at the highest possible level. This was not intended behavior based on every other leveled list for the same purpose. (Bug #21537)</li>
<li>LCharSynth lacked the proper leveled list calculation flags which resulted in numerous generated encounters with them spawning everything at the highest possible level. This was not intended behavior based on every other leveled list for the same purpose. (Bug #21538)</li>
<li>Paladin Brandis stands in one spot aboard the Prydwen because his post-quest NPC has no sandbox package. (Bug #21256)</li>
<li>Mirelurk Hunters were incorrectly assigned the skin formlist for Mirelurk Kings & Queens despite them having proper skins for them defined. The formlist to contain the proper skins was missing from the game. (Bug #20566)</li>
<li>Several protectrons in Nuka-World had incorrectly applied the DLC04_GZSetConsciousOnHit that had invalid properties attached. (Bug #21946) [NR]</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The ammo for the Thirst Zapper weapon should be removed from the player whenever the gun is dropped, otherwise the player will have an invisible weight reduction of up to 10 units due to the ammo weight. (Bug #21281)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Quest Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Numerous random events (possibly every single one) were broken and had to be fixed due to the following problems:
 <ul>
  <li>Shutdown stages that attempted to rearm their triggers using aliases which had already been cleared, thus preventing the triggers from resetting.</li>
  <li>Controlling events running on these quests to stop them could not do so because the events they listened for were sent by active triggers. The quests would therefore remain running indefinitely because the triggers were not made active again.</li>
  <li>Affected scripts: REScript, RETriggerScript, REPareentScript</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Removed several NULL pointer properties from The Big Dig (MS16). (Bug #21713)</li>
<li>Random encounters DLC01RESceneKMK02 and DLC01RETravelKMK02 would not stop when they should have completed, blocking any further use of this event from that point forward. (Bug #21692)</li>
<li>Several random encounter quests erroneously try to reset previous stages when shutting down. (REObject_VertibirdKMK01, REObject_VertibirdKMK02, REObject_VertibirdKMK03, RETravel_VertibirdKMK01, RETravel_VertibirdKMK02, DLC01RETravel_VertibirdKMK03, REScene_VertibirdKMK01, REScene_VertibirdKMK02, REScene_VertibirdKMK03) (Bug #21663)</li>
<li>The Diamond City Dialogue quest (DialogueDiamondCity) had a property erroneously pointing to a piece of plywood that should have been pointing to a quest. (Bug #21654)</li>
<li>Invalid NULL properties removed from DLC03DialogueV118. (Bug #21647)</li>
<li>Codsworth was not included in the Vault-Tec DLC companion tracker system. (Bug #21323)</li>
<li>Holt makes a remark about the player wearing a vault suit even when they aren't due to a bad condition check in his dialogue. (Bug #21308)</li>
<li>After completing Confidence Man, Travis Miles does not run his usual random sponsors list. The sponsor list used after completion in RadioDiamondCity had none of the proper random flags set. (Bug #20471)</li>
<li>ActorHello_CIS_Manager prematurely clears aliases when its shutdown stage has processing left to do on those aliases. (Bug #20519)</li>
<li>Random event DLC01REAssaultSC03 incorrectly tries to track target deaths when it doesn't have the supporting quest stages necessary for this. (Bug #21643)</li>
<li>The Radio failsafe quest (DNMasterQuest) did not properly handle certain quest specific radio messages being added or removed from its tracking array, resulting in numerous repeated errors in the logs when trying to process them. (Bug #20484)</li>
<li>The Postman (RESceneRJ02) might not get a proper letter selection due to an off-by-one error in the random selection from the formlist. (Bug #21879)</li>

<li>Removed invalid properties from RESceneKMK07. (Bug #21939)</li>
<li>Removed invalid properties from REObject_VertibirdKMK03. (Bug #21960)</li>
<li>Removed invalid linked aliases from DLC01RETravelKMK01 & DLC01RETravelKMK02. (Bug #21961)</li>
<li>Priscilla never offers to buy fertilizer from the player because the dialogue incorrectly checks her inventory rather than the player's to see if they have any. (Bug #20144)</li>
<li>RESceneTreasureHuntMaster was referencing the wrong script for casting purposes in the shutdown stage which resulted in the subquests not being terminated properly. (Bug #20758)</li>
<li>Ada drops one of her idle messages about the area calming the player due to an incorrect gender check. (Bug #20473)</li>
<li>Travis Miles never does the news report for rescuing Rex Goodman because the controller scene in RadioDiamondCity was referencing an invalid quest instead of the correct one. (Bug #20472)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>An erroneous script once attached to PlayerPerk has been compiled to a stub to avoid letting it generate endless stack dumps which then impair performance. The script was removed from PlayerPerk officially in Patch 1.7, but the compiled code lingers behind due to Papyrus data baked in to saves started before that patch was released. (Bug #21655)</li>
<li>holdupEffectScript: The bonus application for the Lady Killer and Black Widow perks was not being assigned correctly due to a syntax error in the getperkBonus() function. (Bug #21795)</li>
<li>DN131_CommonsTriggerScript: No sanity checking for the quest running when aliases and scenes are called to fill/start. (Bug #21714)</li>

<li>WorkshopNPCScript: Fixed superfluous calls to WoundActor() that did not need to be made which were causing severe lag upon arriving at a settlement at the start of an attack. (Bug #21578)</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: Sanity check against out of index array values when updating furniture positions. (Bug #21656)</li>
<li>WorkshopFloraDamageHelperScript: Fixed cleanup of crop markers that would lead to invisible crops and save bloat generated from hundreds of invalid markers throughout the game world. (Bug #21894)</li>
<li>WorkshopAttackScript: Prevent a settlement from calling its workshop reset while it is under attack. This solves both thread locking and performance issues. (Bug #21895)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Further work to resolve thread locking issues with the ModifyResourceData() and SetResourceData() functions. (Bug #21896)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Proper thread locking has been applied to the WoundActor() function. (Bug #21898)</li>

If you ARE using the official UI, place UFO4P at the very top of your list.</li>
<li>Changes to the way CreateActorPUBLIC is called have been reverted. This will restore full API compatibility for any external callers. A new function specifically for use by WorkshopScript to make Brahmins with has been created. (Bug #21002)</li>
<li>Official Patch 1.7 has corrected all typos for "Nuka Cola" that should be "Nuka-Cola". As a result, all of our corrections for this issue have been removed as they are now ITM records.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Trough water types (IntTroughWater, ExtTroughWater) erroneously had an activation name filled in which caused them to display "MaterialWaterTrough" when trying to fill or drink from them in survival mode. (Bug #20883)</li>
<li>LegendaryModRule_AllowedKeywords_ArmorBodyPartChest is incorrectly allowing more than chest armors to turn legendary due to an incorrectly added ObjectTypeArmor keyword. The erroneous keyword is already in use on legendary armor rules for other body parts. (Bug #20844)</li>
<li>Perfectly Preserved Pie is not correctly flagged as a food item. (Bug #20835)</li>
<li>Due to having a zero duration setting, Cave Fungus, Refreshing Beverage, X-111 Compound, Curie's Healthpak, and Mutant Hound Chops would fail to provide the proper amount of radiation removal in survival mode. (Bug #20737)</li>
<li>Gunner Guard outfits can spawn for NPCs who also use other leg armor which then causes those NPCs to choose to wear their leg armor and nothing else. (Bug #20837)</li>
<li>Nick Valentine will not reequip his original trench coat if the player had given him a different one and then later took it away due to improper flags placed on it. (Bug #20840)</li>
<li>Strong will not reequip his original armor if the player gave him different equipment and later took it back. This is due to his default outfit using the wrong armor entries. (Bug #20841)</li>
<li>Curie will not reequip her original clothing if the player exchanges it for something else due to the wrong versions being used in her default outfit. (Bug #20842)</li>
<li>Roast Yao Guai was incorrectly set to deliver 500% melee damage when the intent was clearly to provide 10%. Though the text indicates a +10 point flat amount, this is not possible to do using food effects so it's pretty clear someone forgot to mark it as +10%. (Bug #19675)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk & Stat Fixes</u></b>

<li>Level 2 of the Basher perk was incorrectly providing a 100% chance to cripple limbs when it should have been 10%. (Bug #20961)</li>

<li>During Taking Independence (Min02) if the player has already cleared the Castle, the quest journal will still indicate you are meeting Preston to plan the attack you already finished. The journal text was attached to the wrong log entry in the quest setup. (Bug #20976)</li>
<li>In The Secret of Cabot House (MS09) if the player kills Lorenzo at Parsons, Jack is never moved back to his house, the Cabots never eventually switch to their "old people" versions, and the final journal entry has the wrong text due to a variable not being set properly when Lorenzo dies. (Bug #20861, Bug #19999)</li>
<li>In The Big Dig (MS16) it was possible to have the game tell you you had looted Hancock's stash even if you convinced Bobbi to leave due to Stage 240 incorrectly containing a "Run on Stop" flag. (Bug #20860) [NR]</li>

<li>WorkshopNPCScript, WorkshopParentScript, LegendaryItemQuestScript: Merged updates from official patch 1.7.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DN135_GwinnettBreweryTerminal2: The "Main Brewery Tours" entry for this terminal duplicated the "Craft Wing Tours" entry that comes before it. This has been fixed by copying the tour info from the other terminal which covers the same topic. (Bug #20878)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Texture & Material Fixes</u></b>

</ul>

<p class="h">v1.0.4c (2016-07-10)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The new argument added to the CreateActorPUBLIC function has been moved to the final position in the function definition to avoid breaking the expected API in future DLC and mods that might be calling it. This also allowed us to drop 2 scripts from the archive that no longer need to be edited as well.</li>
<li>The fixes for the AI pack WorkshopSandboxRelaxation20x4 have been removed as they appear to be greatly aggravating an existing engine bug where settlers spontaneously change physical appearance, gender, race, and lose any items the player has given them. The underlying issue has NOT been fixed by Bethesda but this should mitigate most of the worst effects of it. Settlers will still change clothing on a regular basis, but this is harmless and appears to be an unannounced intentional feature added to the system with Patch 1.6. Settlers who are already bugged will unfortunately retain the bad behavior. It is not known yet if they will eventually return to normal.</li>
<li>Removed the workshop script from Swanson as this prevents the peaceful entry into Covenant for some reason.</li>

<li>Live & Love #2 perk was not functional due to the ability which applies it incorrectly referencing magazine #3, which is for carry weight. (Bug #20346)</li>
<li>Live & Love #9 perk was not functional for the same reason, and needed a new perk application effect to make sure it separates for robots because this one needs to check for magazine #9 and NOT #3 either.

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>

<li>Level 3 of Idiot Savant was mistakenly checking for Intelligence of 6 twice, which left out 5, and the effectiveness chance was off by 1% as well. The Intelligence 8 condition also had unnecessary weapon type conditions that should not have been there. (Bug #19676)</li>
<li>The Tesla Science magazine perk was not providing the bonus described due to the use of an incorrect keyword. (Bug #20139)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<b><u>Settlement & Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Settlers assigned to scavenging stations walk around everywhere with their weapon drawn, often pointing it at things for no reason. This was due to the AI package WorkshopScavengeSandbox7x14 having the "Weapon Drawn" flag set when it doesn't need to be. (Bug #19652)</li>
<li>Provisioners, Pack Brahmin, and Caravan Guards were retaining their names after reassignment due to a missing "Clears Name When Removed" flag on the aliases in the Workshop Parent quest. (Bug #19653)</li>
<li>The High Tech Desk [Dirty] (workshop_co_HighTechDesk01_Dirty) was using the incorrect component type for the wood. (Bug #19680)</li>

<li>Player housing ruined stove is not correctly labeled to allow it to be built in the workshop UI. (Bug #20133)</li>
<li>Lightboxes are incorrectly filed under the Misc category in the workshop UI. They should be listed with the other lights. (Bug #20134)</li>
<li>Aluminum Tray (LukowskisPottedMeatUnfilled) should scrap to aluminum, not steel. (Bug #20135)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Strong should no longer begin his response dialogue when asked about his relationship status with the player before the player has actually finished speaking. (COMStrongTalk) (Bug #19657)</li>
<li>At the end of Dependency (V81_03), if the player convinced Bobby to get clean, talking to Tina will abort after convincing her to join a settlement due to an unfilled property in the scene that was supposed to bring up the settlement selection window. If you succeeded in convincing her but never got the menu, you will get a pop-up menu upon running the patch which will ask you where you want to send her. (Bug #19581)</li>
<li>When completing Dependency (V81_03) Bobby, Tina, and Rachel do not have their essential status removed because the stage 1000 fragment calls stop too soon and ends up clearing the aliases before the quest is done. (Bug #20142)</li>
<li>Cambridge Polymer Labs (DN015) leaves undroppable quest items in your inventory even if the puzzle quest (DN015Puzzle) to make the armor is completed. DN015 was not stopping DN015Puzzle in stage 100. (Bug #19586)</li>
<li>When negotiating with Deb at Bunker Hill for Traffic Jam (FFBunkerHill02) the rewards given are incorrect due to checking the wrong set of quest stages for the negotiated payment. (Bug #19710)</li>
<li>The Order Up quest (DialogueDrumlinDiner) does not clear aliases for the dead bodies, resulting in them staying in the game forever and respawning their loot. The quest is also not stopped if everyone at the diner has been killed, or if the player aggro'd them all and they're all hostile. (Bug #19720)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Faculty Terminal at Shaw High School (DN020_StaffMemosSubTerminal) is incorrectly named as Principal Tanner's Terminal and incorrectly returns back to Tanner's personal terminal instead of the proper Faculty Terminal main menu. (Bug #19876)</li>
<li>The Dean's Terminal at University Point (DN088_DeansSubTerminalMail) has a mail relay submenu with incorrect dates. It is talking about events from 2077 but is dated 2285, which is incorrect. (Bug #19741)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Texture & Material Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The material swaps for Covert Operations 7 (CustomMaterialSwap001D1FEA) and Covert Operations 8 (CustomMaterialSwap001D1FF1) were switched and caused them to display the wrong artwork when dropped in the world. (Bug #20009)</li>
