[Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars]
-To mod it
How to start a C&C3 mod if you got The Ultimate Collection
1. Get to the mod browser
-Install Bibber's Fixed Launchers for TUC.
-In Origin, go to [Origin] -> [Application Settings] -> [Advanced]. You will see a section at the top that says "Your games will be installed to the following location". Select and copy that location.
-Open a Windows file browser window, paste the copied location in the address bar, and press [Enter] to go there.
-Go into the "Command and Conquer 3 TW and KW\Command Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars" folder.
-Drag "CNC3.exe" to your desktop, and hold down both [Ctrl] and [Alt] before releasing it, to create a shortcut.
-Rename the shortcut to "C&C3 Control Panel"
-Open the shortcut's properties, and behind everything on the "Target" line (including quotes), add a space and then "-ui" (without the quotes)

Now you can open the C&C3 control panel, click "Game Browser", and open its Mods tab.


2. Adding mods to C&C3's mods tab

-Open a Windows file browser window, type (or paste) "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\" in the address bar (again, without the quotes), and press [Enter] to go there. This should go to your Documents folder (In Windows 7, anyway).
-If there is no folder called "Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars" in there, create it.
-Inside that folder, make sure you have a folder called "Mods"
-Inside that folder, create a folder for the mod, and put the mod's files inside it. Make sure the .skudef file is inside that mod folder, and not deeper down the tree.

(Re)open the Game Browser on the C&C3 control panel, and the mod should show up in there.

 

 

Extra: how to make a shortcut straight to a mod

 

It is possible to launch C&C3 mods without using the C&C3 Control Panel, though the instructions for this are largely the same as to get the C&C3 control panel link.

 

-Create a shortcut to CNC3.exe as described in the first section.

-Open the shortcut's properties, and behind everything on the "Target" line (including quotes), add a space, then "-modconfig" (without the quotes), then another space, and then the full path of the control file of the mod (surrounded by quotes). It's the file with the .skudef extension.

 

So if your C&C3 is in "C:\Games\Origin Games\Command and Conquer 3 TW and KW\Command Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars" and your mod is in "C:\Games\mods\Tiberian Dawn", that target line will end up looking like this:

 

"C:\Games\Origin Games\Command and Conquer 3 TW and KW\Command Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\CNC3.exe" -modconfig "C:\Games\mods\Tiberian Dawn\TiberianDawn_0.2.SkuDef"
