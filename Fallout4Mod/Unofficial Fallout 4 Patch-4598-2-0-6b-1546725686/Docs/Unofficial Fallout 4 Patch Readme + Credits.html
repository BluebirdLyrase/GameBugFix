<p class="h"><a name="des">1. What the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch (UFO4P) Does</a></p>
This mod is a joint effort to fix the vast amount of bugs currently existing in Fallout 4. If you're experiencing a bug with Fallout 4 and it isn't fixed by the UFO4P yet please <a href="https://afktrack.iguanadons.net/index.php?a=issues&project=32">report the bug on the UFO4P tracker</a> in as much detail as possible. Please search first to ensure you aren't posting something already there; with more than a thousand active entries currently it's very likely it already is! Thank you for any contributions! For details on what qualifies as a bug, and what you can do to report it, see our <a href="https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/4420-frequently-asked-questions-bugs/">Bug FAQ</a>.

<br><br>If your bugs is of the more important variety, such as a broken quest, broken settlement mechanics, broken perks, etc, you should also submit the report of your issue to Bethesda as well. Use their <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/fallout_feedback">feedback form</a> to do so and provide them as much detail as you would us. We would all prefer the bigger things to be fixed by them, right?

<br><br><span class="attention">Warning: Only use the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch with the latest release version of Fallout 4 patched through Steam! Using it on an older version may cause bugs or things not to be fixed that were advertised as such!</span> It will of course be updated to match each official update, including having fixes removed that are included in official updates.

<p class="h"><a name="notes">2. Known Issues, Incompatibilities and Notes</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Mod Manager is recommended</b>: If you're reading this (which means you've opened the archive directly) and you're new to using mods, it's recommended to use a mod manager such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20032">Wrye Bash</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/modmanager/">Nexus Mod Manager</a> to install and manage your mods. This will prevent problems of conflicts, leftover files after uninstallation and other issues. This is especially important in Fallout 4 with script files, since they are separate from the ESP they can overwrite other script files and thus override even if the mod is earlier-loaded, and remain behind still active if it's uninstalled. If you use many mods, it's also recommended to use <a href="https://loot.github.io/">LOOT</a> to prevent load order problems.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h"><a name="install">3. Manual Installation</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> Extract the contents of <b>Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.7z</b>, into your <b>Fallout 4\Data</b> folder. The default location is C:\Program files\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data. There should be an ESP file, 2 BA2 files, and a modgroups file for use with xEdit.

<br><br><b>2.)</b> Launch the game. When the main menu comes up, click on "Mods".

<br><br><b>3.)</b> Press "T" to go to the load order. In the menu that comes up, click on "Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.esp". A checkmark should appear next to it to indicate it's active.

<br><br><b>4.)</b> Press "X" to enter the menu to reorder the plugins. Use the arrow keys to make sure "Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.esp" is at the very top of the list. Press "X" when you're done.

<br><br><b>5.)</b> Press "Esc" until you get the prompt telling you that the game needs to reload its data. Once the menu is back, you may then load your existing saves or start a new game.

<br><br><span class="attention">Do not clean the file with FO4Edit! We have already cleaned it.</span>

<br><br>Your load order should start like this once it has been installed correctly:
<ul>
<li>Fallout4.esm</li>
<li>DLCRobot.esm</li>
<li>DLCworkshop01.esm</li>
<li>DLCCoast.esm</li>
<li>DLCWorkshop02.esm</li>
<li>DLCWorkshop03.esm</li>
<li>DLCNukaWorld.esm</li>
<li>DLCUltraHighResolution.esm</li>
<li>Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.esp</li>
<li>[Everything else you have installed]</li>
</ul>

<br>Please note that this load order should be set automatically by the game and will not be changeable at the user level, it is just listed here for completeness. Fallout 4 will not deviate from this even if the plugins.txt file is edited manually.

<br><br>If you are having trouble with your mod manager recognizing the false flagged ESP file, you need to update it. Wrye Bash as of version 304.2 will support this, Nexus Mod Manager should have no trouble with versions 0.45 and higher.

<br><br>The Hi-Res Texture Pack DLC is not required to use the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch. Its ESM file is listed here for completeness as well.

<br><br><b>6.)</b> Click Play and enjoy your much-improved Fallout 4.

<br><br>The modgroups file is useful for doing conflict detection using xEdit and is explained in the <a href="https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/3-modgroups.html">Tome of xEdit</a>.

<br><br><b><u>Upgrading</u></b>
<br><br>If you are upgrading manually, simply install the new ESP and BA2 files into your Data folder. Otherwise consult the documentation for your preferred mod manager for how to update a package installation.

<br><br>Once the updated files are installed, simply start the game as usual. UFO4P will perform any necessary updates when the game first loads. You may see messages on screen for things that have been updated. You can resume play right away.

<p class="h"><a name="uninstall">4. Uninstalling (Manual Version)</a></p>
Due to the nature of Fallout 4 mods, especially those adding scripts, it is strongly discouraged to attempt uninstalling a mod from your active game. Any mod that is more than pure mesh or texture replacements has the possibility to leave behind permanent changes to your save that you may not want. This is not something modders can correct for. It is how the game was designed by Bethesda. No support will be provided for anyone who uninstalls this mod from an active game and continues on with that save. Even if that means you reinstalled the patch afterward.

<br><br>If you insist on removing it for whatever reason, simply delete the ESP and BA2, then load your game without them. You will get a missing content warning. Say yes, and continue playing.

<p class="h"><a name="dis">5. Disclaimer</a></p>
The Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch is provided free and "as is" for use at your own risk; the creators cannot be held responsible/liable for anything that happens while using it. It is recommended to only use the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch with the version of Fallout 4 it was created for. This product is not created by, nor associated with, Bethesda Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Zenimax Media, nor any of their affiliates.

<p class="h"><a name="perms">6. Permissions</a></p>
The following terms of use must be adhered to with regard to the unofficial patches:
<ul>
<li>You may upload <u>unmodified</u> versions of the patch to any website of your choosing so long as the documentation is retained as-is and the intended use of the mod is on a standard Fallout 4 game. All credits must be properly maintained. Distribution for the intent of using it on an incompatible platform such as Fallout 4 VR is strictly forbidden.</li>
<li>Translation of the unofficial patches into other languages is permitted so long as the English documentation is also included and all credits are properly maintained.</li>
<li>Assets such as mesh files (.nif), textures, scripts, audio files, and other things found in the BA2 file may be freely used as the basis for your own work in order to help prevent fixes from being lost due to work starting from broken vanilla assets instead.</li>
<li>You are permitted to use the unofficial patches as master files in your own work for the purpose of ensuring that fixes are not lost. Please try to be sure any changes to things which have been fixed do not cause further problems as we will not be able to provide support under those conditions.</li>
<li>Altering fixes is specifically prohibited as this tends to lead to serious problems. If you think you've found an issue with a fix, please report it to us. Do not simply upload something that amounts to "this is the right way to do it" because more often than not, this turns out to be false and people mistakenly believe we are at fault when we are not aware of what's been done.</li>
<li>The Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch may not be included in any "mod packs" under any circumstances. A mod pack is defined as any collection of mods assembled by a third party and offered for download on the internet as a single package. These packages are often distributed without the permission of their authors and the people who package them routinely refuse to provide support for them.</li>
</ul>
